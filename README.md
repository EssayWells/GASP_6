# GASP_6
GASP version 6: code for simulation and analysis of polyhedral framework crystal structures

The included PDF files are a manual ("GASP guidance") and a paper which is suitable as a reference if publishing anything using this code, with DOI 10.1080/08927022.2015.1032277

The included .cif files are example input structures (a faujasite zeolite and a ZIF MOF).
The .inp files are example command inputs as discussed in the manual.

The .cpp and .h files are source code.

The shell script makegasp.sh compiles the source code into executables.

Don't forget to run dos2unix on the input file examples if you're not on Windows.
